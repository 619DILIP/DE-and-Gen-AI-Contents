`DELETE` is a keyword command in SQL used to remove a specific record from a table or relation. The `DELETE` command generally includes a `WHERE` clause to specify the records for deletion. However, much like the `UPDATE` command, there is a risk that if the `WHERE` clause is not specified, it will remove all records from the table. The `DELETE` command removes one record at a time and logs each deleted row, which is why it's not considered good practice to delete all records in a table using `DELETE` when you want to maintain the table structure. This is where `TRUNCATE` offers a better solution as it's both faster and removes the data by deallocating the data pages used to store the records. `DELETE` commands can also activate a trigger and work with indexed views.

<br>

Deleting records from a database is common when we need to remove unwanted data, such as looking at student records maintained at a college. When a student drops out of a course before the drop deadline, all grades and assessments from that course are deleted from the records as they no longer impact the student's GPA or show as a registered course. Therefore, they would include a few `DELETE` commands to both remove the student from the course and execute commands to remove any records or assessments associated with that course and that student.

- Basic Syntax for the `DELETE` command

```sql
DELETE FROM TABLE_NAME
WHERE [condition];
```

- Example to `DELETE` a student, with student_id = 'student1@uni.edu', from an enrollment table for course_id = 101

```sql
DELETE FROM enrollment
WHERE student_id = 'student1@uni.edu' AND course_id = 101;
```

- Example to `DELETE` all of the above student's grades from a student_assessments table

```sql
DELETE FROM student_assessments
WHERE student_id = 'student1@uni.edu';
```
