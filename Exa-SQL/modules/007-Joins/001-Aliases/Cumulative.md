- An alias is used to give a temporary name to a table or a column in a table for the purpose of supporting a specific query.

## Advantages of Aliases in MySQL
- It provides a very useful feature that allows us to achieve complex tasks quickly.
- It makes column or table names more readable.
- It allows us to combine two or more columns.
- It makes the table more user-friendly.

Using aliases has a number of benefits for your applications, such as:

* **Resolving Naming Conflicts**: When dealing with complex queries involving multiple tables with similar column names, aliases can help avoid naming conflicts.
* **Enhancing User Interface View**: When developing applications with a database backend, developers can use aliases to provide more user-friendly and understandable names for the data presented to users.
* **Code Refactoring**: Aliases make it easier to refactor (restructure existing computer code without changing its external behavior) code by providing a way to change the name of a table or column in one place without affecting the rest of the code.
* **Self-Joins or Complex Joins**: Aliases can be used to distinguish between different instances of the same table in a `SELF-JOIN` or to simplify complex join conditions. You will see aliases used often in all types of join statements.
* **Column Renaming**: Aliases help in giving more meaningful names to columns, thereby making the output of a query easier to understand.
* **Table Renaming**: When working with multiple tables, aliases can be used to create shorter and more readable names for table names.

These are just a few of the many reasons that developers choose to use aliases when writing queries.

Table 1: Plants
|plant_id|plant_name   |species                          |price|
|--------|-------------|------------------------|------|
| 1           |Venus Flytrap|Dionaea muscipula                 |19.99|
| 2           |Pitcher Plant|Nepenthes                                |29.99|
| 3           |Sundew       |Drosera                                      |14.99|
| 4           |Cobra Plant     |Darlingtonia californica         |24.99|


Table 2: Customers

|customer_id|first_name|last_name|email                       |purchased_plant_id|
|-----------|----------|---------|----------------------------|------------------|
|         1|John      |Wheeler  |john.wheeler@example.com    |                 3|
|         2|Jane      |Smith    |jane.smith@example.com      |                 4|
|         3|Sussie    |Halloween|sussie.halloween@example.com|                 1|


In this example, we will have two tables `Plants` and `Customers`. The `Plants` table will contain information about the plants, and the `Customers` table will contain information about the customers. The `Customers` table has a `purchased_plant_id` column, which is a foreign key referencing the `plant_id` in the `Plants` table.

In SQL, column aliases are used to provide a different name for a column in the query result. This is helpful for clarity and readability. In our case, we'll use a column alias to associate purchased plants with customers in the query result.

```sql
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, email,
plant_name AS purchased_plant
FROM customers 
JOIN plants ON customers.purchased_plant_id = plants.plant_id;
```

The keyword `AS` is used to create an alias named `purchased_plant` for the column `plant_name`. This way, when you read the query, it is clear that the `plant_name` column is being displayed as `purchased_plant`. This demonstrates an alias by column.

Another method for creating an alias is on the table itself. The same query as above can be used to illustrate how this works.

```sql
SELECT cust.customer_id, cust.first_name, cust.last_name, cust.email,
plnt.plant_name AS purchased_plant
FROM customers cust
JOIN plants plnt ON cust.purchased_plant_id = plnt.plant_id;
```

Notice how after `customers` there is the abbreviation `cust`. This is to indicate that we are giving an alias to the `Customers` table. The same can be said for the `plants`, which is abbreviated to `plnt`. Also, notice how the alias is used throughout the entire query. That is important because if you are going to use a table alias, then it must be used throughout the entire query. This, however, is not the only way to write this and get the same result. Some developers find it clearer to write the same query as follows:

```sql
SELECT cust.customer_id, cust.first_name, cust.last_name, cust.email,
plnt.plant_name AS purchased_plant
FROM customers AS cust
JOIN plants AS plnt ON cust.purchased_plant_id = plnt.plant_id;
```

Something to keep in mind is that `plant_name` is a column in the table with the alias of `purchased_plant`, while `customers` has an alias of `cust`, which is referring to the `Customers` table, and `plants` has an alias of `plnt`, which is referring to the `Plants` table. 

It is extremely common to see aliases used in SQL queries as they help prevent ambiguity, especially in larger databases where the same data may exist in multiple tables. By providing aliases for tables and columns, developers make their queries more readable, which helps avoid naming conflicts and enhances overall code clarity.

Aliases are especially useful when dealing with complex joins or subqueries involving multiple tables, as they help distinguish between different instances of the same table and make the code more maintainable. In some cases, aliases are required; otherwise, the query will not work. 

**OUTPUT**: 

|customer_id|first_name|last_name|email                       |purchased_plant|
|-----------|----------|---------|----------------------------|---------------|
|          1|John      |Wheeler  |john.wheeler@example.com    |Sundew         |
|         2|Jane      |Smith    |jane.smith@example.com      |Cobra Plant    |
|         3|Sussie    |Halloween|sussie.halloween@example.com|Venus Flytrap  |

* Aliases are commonly used to simplify and improve the readability of SQL statements. They make it easier to write queries and enhance the overall clarity of the code.
* In some scenarios, the use of aliases becomes necessary to construct specific queries. Aliases can be essential for addressing naming conflicts, especially in more complex queries involving multiple tables or calculations.
* Aliases play a significant role in simplifying the writing of SQL statements by making them more readable and contributing to easier maintenance of the code.
