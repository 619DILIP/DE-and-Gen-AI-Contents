After completing this module, associates should be able to:
- Describe what an `OUTER JOIN` is
- Write commands that make use of `OUTER JOIN`

</details>
<details><summary>Description</summary>
<br>

* An `OUTER JOIN` yields non-matching records as well as matching records from both tables.
  * If rows in a connected table don't match, `NULL` values will be shown.
* MySQL does not support `OUTER JOIN`; you must use a `LEFT JOIN` or `RIGHT JOIN` to get the behavior of an `OUTER JOIN`.
* In some other dialects of SQL, you can use a `FULL OUTER JOIN` or `FULL JOIN` to combine two tables' data together.

Table: PartyGuests

| guestid | guestname |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1      | Alice     |
| 2      | Bob       |
| 3      | Charlie   |
| 4      | David     |

Table: PartyAttendees

| attendeeid | attendeename |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| 1          | Alice        |
| 3          | Charlie      |
| 5          | Eve          |

Let's consider a scenario where you have two tables: one containing a list of people invited to a party, `PartyGuests`, and another containing a list of people who actually attended the party, `PartyAttendees`. We'll use a `FULL OUTER JOIN` to combine these tables and see the complete picture, including guests who didn't attend and attendees who were not on the original guest list.

```sql
SELECT PartyGuests.GuestID, PartyAttendees.AttendeeID, PartyGuests.GuestName,
    PartyAttendees.AttendeeName  
FROM PartyGuests  
FULL OUTER JOIN PartyAttendees ON PartyGuests.GuestID = PartyAttendees.AttendeeID;
```

This could also be written by omitting OUTER and yield the same result.

```sql
SELECT PartyGuests.GuestID, PartyAttendees.AttendeeID, PartyGuests.GuestName,
    PartyAttendees.AttendeeName
FROM PartyGuests
FULL JOIN PartyAttendees ON PartyGuests.GuestID = PartyAttendees.AttendeeID;
```
OUTPUT:
| guestid | attendeeid | guestname | attendeename |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 1      | 1          | Alice     | Alice        |
| 2      | NULL       | Bob       | NULL         |
| 3      | 3          | Charlie   | Charlie      |
| 4      | NULL       | David     | NULL         |
| NULL   | 5          | NULL      | Eve          |

This example demonstrates how a `FULL OUTER JOIN` helps you see the complete picture of guests and attendees at a party, including those who were on the guest list but didn't attend and those who attended but were not on the guest list.

<details><summary>Summary</summary> 
<br>

- `OUTER JOIN`, also known as `FULL OUTER JOIN`, returns all records from both tables, whether the other table matches or not.
- `OUTER JOIN` has two types: `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`.
- You can use a `FULL OUTER JOIN` or `FULL JOIN` to combine two tables' data together.

**Syntax**:  
SELECT column_name(s)  
FROM table1  
FULL OUTER JOIN table2  
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
