After completing this module, associates should be able to:

- Describe what an `INNER JOIN` is.
- Write commands that make use of `INNER JOIN`.

<details><summary>Description</summary>
<br>

An `INNER JOIN` selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are data in the "Table1" table that do not have matches in "Table2", these records will not be shown.

Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)  
FROM table1  
INNER JOIN table2  
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

<details><summary>Real World Application</summary>
<br>

- `INNER JOIN` can be a faster way to gather information between related tables when compared to subqueries. 
- `INNER JOIN` helps in selecting data that has matching values between two entities.

Table: Users 

| userid | username       | email                   |
| -------| ---------------| ----------------------- |
| 1      | LolipopMagee   | Sarah.Magee@example.com |
| 2      | ToBeOrNotToBe  | harry.smith@example.com |
| 3      | JingleTrees    | bob.johnson@example.com |

Table: Account

| accountid | userid | accountnumber  | balance |
| --------- | ------ | ------------- | ------- |
| 101       | 1      | A123456       | 1000.00 |
| 102       | 2      | B789012       | 2500.50 |
| 103       | 3      | C345678       | 500.25  |

In this example, we have two tables: `Users` and `Account`.   
The `Users` table contains information about users, and the `Account` table contains information about their accounts.  
The `UserID` in the `Account` table is a foreign key referencing the `UserID` in the `Users` table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.  

Now, let's say you want to perform an `INNER JOIN` to get information about users and their corresponding accounts: 

```sql
-- INNER JOIN example  

SELECT Users.UserID, Users.UserName, Users.Email, Account.AccountNumber, Account.Balance  
FROM Users  
INNER JOIN Account ON Users.UserID = Account.UserID;  
```  

This query retrieves the `UserID`, `UserName`, `Email`, `AccountNumber`, and `Balance` for users who have accounts. The `INNER JOIN` is performed based on the matching `UserID` in both tables. 

**NOTE**: If you are following along, be sure to use the table name **Users**, NOT **User**, or you will get an error, as User is a keyword in SQL.

**OUTPUT**:

| userid | username      | email                   | accountnumber | balance  |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------------- | --------------| -------  |
| 1      | LolipopMagee  | Sarah.Magee@example.com | A123456       | 1000.00  |
| 2      | ToBeOrNotToBe | harry.smith@example.com | B789012       | 2500.50  |
| 3      | JingleTrees   | bob.johnson@example.com | C345678       | 500.25   |

We could have achieved the same result without a join by doing the following query:

```sql
SELECT Users.UserID, Users.UserName, Users.Email, Account.AccountNumber, Account.Balance
FROM Users, Account
WHERE Users.UserID = Account.UserID;
```

OUTPUT:

| userid | username      | email                    | accountnumber | balance |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------------------| --------------| ------- |
| 1      | LolipopMagee  | Sarah.Magee@example.com  | A123456       | 1000.00 |
| 2      | ToBeOrNotToBe | harry.smith@example.com  | B789012       | 2500.50 |
| 3      | JingleTrees   | bob.johnson@example.com  | C345678       | 500.25  |

This implicitly creates a join condition in the WHERE clause, and the result will include only the rows where the `UserID` matches between the `Users` and `Account` tables. However, it's generally recommended to use explicit JOIN syntax for better readability and maintainability of your queries.

* `INNER JOIN` restricts record retrieval from Table1 and Table2 to those that satisfy the join requirement.
* `INNER JOIN` is the most widely used form of JOIN and is very common within the SQL community.
