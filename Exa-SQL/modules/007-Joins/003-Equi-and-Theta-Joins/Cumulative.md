After completing this module, associates should be able to:

- Describe the use of `EQUI JOIN` and `THETA JOIN` in a database
- Distinguish between `EQUI JOIN` and `THETA JOIN`

</details>
<details><summary>Description</summary>
<br>

* `THETA JOIN` allows us to merge two tables based on an arbitrary condition and is represented by the symbol theta (Θ or θ).
  * In other words, a `THETA JOIN` is a join in which some arbitrary comparison relationship is used. For example (”>”, “<”, “>=”, etc.).
  * For a `THETA JOIN`, we make associations on columns that have the same datatype but may represent different information for each table. For instance, we may join tables based on how old someone was when they got their driver’s license by using comparisons that include a “birth_year” column and a “years_as_driver” column.
  * The general case of the JOIN operation is called a `THETA JOIN`.
* An `EQUI JOIN` is a `THETA JOIN` that uses the equality operator.
  * `EQUI JOIN` is a common type of join since it creates 1:1 relationships between matching data in the associated tables.
* `EQUI JOIN` performs a join based on equality or matching column(s) values of the associated tables.

**Syntax for Equi-Join**:  
SELECT *  
FROM Table1  
JOIN Table2 ON Table1.Column = Table2.Column;  

**Syntax for Theta-Join**:  
SELECT *  
FROM Table1, Table2  
WHERE Table1.Column > Table2.Column;

<details><summary>Real World Application</summary>
<br>

Real world applications include:

* `EQUI JOINS` are suitable for scenarios where you need to match records based on the equality of specific columns.
  * Matching Data for Analysis - you may have data spread across different tables, and you want to analyze or combine information based on common attributes.
* `THETA JOINS` offer more flexibility by allowing a broader range of conditions, making them useful for scenarios involving complex criteria or non-equality conditions.
  * Pattern Matching - Finding all customers whose names contain a particular substring.
  * Date Range Matching - Finding all transactions that occurred within a certain time period.
  * Numeric Range Conditions - Finding customers with purchase amounts between certain thresholds.

### Table: Authors

```
CREATE TABLE Authors (
    authorid INT,
    authorf_name VARCHAR(50),
    authorl_name VARCHAR(50),
    birthyear INT
);
```

```
INSERT INTO Authors (authorid, authorf_name, authorl_name, birthyear)
VALUES
    (101, 'F. Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 1896),
    (102, 'Harper', 'Lee', 1926),
    (103, 'J.R.R.', 'Tolkien', 1892),
    (104, 'George', 'Orwell', 1903);
```

### Table: Books

```
CREATE TABLE Books (
    bookid INT,
    title VARCHAR(100),
    genre VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(5, 2),
    authorid INT
);
```

```
INSERT INTO Books (bookid, title, genre, price, authorid)
VALUES
    (1, 'The Great Gatsby', 'Fiction', 14.50, 101),
    (2, 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Fiction', 12.75, 102),
    (3, 'The Hobbit', 'Fantasy', 19.50, 103),
    (4, '1984', 'Dystopian', 16.25, 104);
```

### Equi-Join Example

- Perform an Equi-Join to retrieve information about books and their corresponding author details
- based on the equality of the AuthorID columns.

```
SELECT 
    Books.BookID, 
    Books.Title, 
    Books.Genre, 
    Books.Price, 
    Authors.AuthorF_Name, 
    Authors.AuthorL_Name, 
    Authors.BirthYear
FROM Books
JOIN Authors 
ON Books.AuthorID = Authors.AuthorID;
```

**OUTPUT**:  
| bookid | title                | genre     | price | authorf_name | authorl_name | birthyear |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|-------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1      | The Great Gatsby     | Fiction   | 14.50 | F. Scott     | Fitzgerald   | 1896      |
| 2      | To Kill a Mockingbird| Fiction   | 12.75 | Harper       | Lee          | 1926      |
| 3      | The Hobbit           | Fantasy   | 19.50 | J.R.R.       | Tolkien      | 1892      |
| 4      | 1984                 | Dystopian | 16.25 | George       | Orwell       | 1903      |

### True Theta Join Example

- Use a Theta Join to retrieve book and author information based on a join condition
- that involves a comparison operator other than equality.

```
SELECT 
    Books.BookID, 
    Books.Title, 
    Books.Genre, 
    Books.Price,
    Authors.AuthorF_Name,
    Authors.AuthorL_Name,
    Authors.BirthYear
FROM Books
JOIN Authors 
ON Books.Price > Authors.BirthYear;  
```

- This query retrieves records where the price of a book is greater than the birth year of the author.

Another Theta Join Example with filtering

- Retrieve books with price conditions as part of the join itself (beyond equality).

```
SELECT 
    Books.BookID, 
    Books.Title, 
    Books.Genre, 
    Books.Price,
    Authors.AuthorF_Name,
    Authors.AuthorL_Name,
    Authors.BirthYear
FROM Books
JOIN Authors 
ON Books.AuthorID = Authors.AuthorID
WHERE Books.Price > 15.00;  
```

**OUTPUT**:  
| bookid | title     | genre    | price | authorf_name | authorl_name | birthyear |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| 3      | The Hobbit| Fantasy  | 19.50 | J.R.R.       | Tolkien      | 1892      |
| 4      | 1984      | Dystopian| 16.25 | George       | Orwell       | 1903      |

- `EQUI JOIN` performs a join based on equality or matching column(s) values of the associated tables. 
- `THETA JOIN` allows us to merge two tables based on the condition represented by theta. 
- It works for all comparison operators and is denoted by the symbol theta.
