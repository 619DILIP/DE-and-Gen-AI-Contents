After completing this module, associates should be able to:

- Describe the use of `SELF JOIN` in a database.
- Utilize `SELF JOIN` in SQL queries.

<details><summary>Description</summary>
<br>

- `SELF JOIN` is a SQL statement that is used to intersect or join a table in the database to itself. We use it when we need to compare data within the same table. 
- This type of joining data with other data in the same table, when a condition is matched, is also known as a Unary relationship.

**Syntax**:   
SELECT column_name(s)  
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2  
WHERE condition;

<details><summary>Real World Application</summary>
<br>

Real-world applications include:

- Querying hierarchical data and comparing records of official reports.
- The main application of this join in MySQL is when a table references data rows in itself.

In the following example, our database will have one table since a `SELF JOIN` is a type of join wherein the data is coming from a single table.

Table: Employees

| employee_id | employee_name       | manager_id |
|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| 1           | CEO                 |            |
| 2           | Marketing Manager    | 1          |
| 3           | Sales Manager        | 1          |
| 4           | Marketing Specialist | 2          |
| 5           | Sales Representative | 3          |
| 6           | Marketing Intern     | 2          |

Using the records from this table, we would like to retrieve our employees and readable information for each employee’s associated manager in the company.

A `SELF JOIN` query will accomplish this task perfectly:

```sql
SELECT e.employee_name AS employee, m.employee_name AS manager  
FROM employees e  
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id  
ORDER BY e.employee_id;
```

Note that we can also execute the same logic by utilizing a query without the `JOIN` keyword:

```sql
SELECT e.employee_name AS employee, m.employee_name AS manager  
FROM employees e, employees m  
WHERE e.manager_id = m.employee_id  
ORDER BY e.employee_id;  
```

OUTPUT:
| employee            | manager          |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Marketing Manager    | CEO              |
| Sales Manager        | CEO              |
| Marketing Specialist | Marketing Manager |
| Sales Representative | Sales Manager     |
| Marketing Intern     | Marketing Manager |

Both examples utilize a `SELF JOIN`. An important note, however, is that the CEO record is not returned from the query due to the `NULL` foreign key reference and the behavior of a simple `SELF JOIN` or a where clause. If we require the CEO data in the result set, we can restructure our `SELF JOIN`.

For instance, if we perform a `LEFT JOIN`, we can pull data with null references. To clarify any confusion, this is still a `SELF JOIN` since we are performing a join referencing a single table.

```sql
SELECT e.employee_name AS employee, m.employee_name AS manager
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m 
ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id
ORDER BY e.employee_id;
```

| employee            | manager          |
|---------------------|------------------|
| CEO                 | NULL             |
| Marketing Manager    | CEO              |
| Sales Manager        | CEO              |
| Marketing Specialist | Marketing Manager |
| Sales Representative | Sales Manager     |
| Marketing Intern     | Marketing Manager |

To accomplish the same output without the use of the `JOIN` keyword, we’ll need a more complex version of this query:

```sql
-- Without JOIN
SELECT e.employee_name AS employee,
( SELECT employee_name
  FROM employees m
  WHERE m.employee_id = e.manager_id) AS manager
FROM employees e
ORDER BY e.employee_id;
```

| employee            | manager          |
|---------------------|------------------|
| CEO                 | NULL             |
| Marketing Manager    | CEO              |
| Sales Manager        | CEO              |
| Marketing Specialist | Marketing Manager |
| Sales Representative | Sales Manager     |
| Marketing Intern     | Marketing Manager |

Each example demonstrates how we can use a single table to query data on itself.

<br>

- `SELF JOIN` is important for querying ordered records by comparing rows in the same table.
- We can utilize `SELF JOIN`, considering the table as two using an alias, so that the table name is not repeated twice, which may lead to errors.
- This type of join is useful for modeling structured data and allows us to compare the rows and produce the required output.
