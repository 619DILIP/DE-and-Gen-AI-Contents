A database schema is the collection of database objects and elements that are logically connected through tables, stored procedures, views, triggers, functions, and more. The schema defines how table relationships should be built and organized within a particular database.

Note: Regarding MySQL, "schema" and "database" are synonymous. For other RDBMSs, multiple schemas are allowed in a database, and each schema allows the ability to grant specific access and permissions to users.

## Advantages

- Allow several users per schema
- Multiple schemas
- Move database objects between schemas
- Manage database objects in a logical group

When a business is working with a relational database, it leverages schemas to manage all of its information, especially related to the sales of products. The business has tables of relational data stored inside the schema for all its products and related sales. Along with this, it has stored procedures, views, and functions associated with this sales information for repeated queries to generate analysis such as quarterly reports to deliver to the company, sales reports for specific items, profit margins, etc.

When working with SQL, you use the keyword `CREATE` to generate a schema, along with all the other components utilized by the schema.

- Generate a new schema in SQL

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA employment;
GO
```

- Generate a table inside a specific schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE employment.employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50)
);
```

- Generate a view inside a specific schema

```sql
CREATE VIEW employment.hr_employees AS
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employment.employees
WHERE department = 'HR';
```
