# Description

There are four (4) properties of a transaction that define key aspects related to its behavior. They can be remembered using the acronym *ACID* described in the previous topic: 
- ***A***tomicity 
- ***C***onsistency
- ***I***solation
- ***D***urability

# Real World Application

Please review how each of these properties can affect real-world applications.

## Atomicity
A bank transaction of debiting $100 from ACC1 and crediting it to ACC2 should be atomic. If either of the statements in this transaction fails, the transaction of transferring funds from ACC1 to ACC2 should fail.

## Consistency
Consider two bank accounts, ACC1 and ACC2, with funds of $10,000 and $9,000, respectively, which total $19,000. After a transaction of transferring $50 from ACC2 to ACC1, the funds in ACC1 are $10,050 and in ACC2 are $8,950, which means the total funds in ACC1 and ACC2 add up to $19,000. Thus, the funds in ACC1 and ACC2 are consistent before and after the transaction.

## Isolation
Consider that user A withdraws $100 and user B withdraws $250 from user ACC1's account, which has a balance of $1,000. Since both A and B draw from ACC1's account, one of the users is required to wait until the other user's transaction is completed to avoid inconsistent data.

## Durability
Any real-life changes made to a database, such as transferring funds, crediting or debiting funds, updating employee details, and updating a student's grades, are durable. Once these transactions are successfully executed, the changes made to the database are permanent, even if an unexpected system failure or error occurs.

# Implementation

For the following examples, consider a banking application that allows funds to transfer between accounts.

## Atomicity
Consider transferring $50 from an account (ACC1) to another account (ACC2) where we check if ACC1 has sufficient funds.

``` sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE bankaccounts SET funds = funds - 50 WHERE account_no = 'ACC1' AND funds > 50;
UPDATE bankaccounts SET funds = funds + 50 WHERE account_no = 'ACC2';
COMMIT;
```
In the above example, debiting $50 from ACC1 and crediting $50 to ACC2 is a single transaction. If the entire transaction was not atomic, then it would be possible for our application to debit ACC1 but not credit ACC2 due to some error.

## Consistency
Building off of this example, let's examine ACC1 and ACC2.

``` sql
SELECT * FROM bankaccounts;
```
Result:
| account_no | funds   |
|------------|---------|
| ACC1       |  850.00 |
| ACC2       | 1150.00 |

From the above table, we can conclude that the sum of funds in ACC1 and ACC2 is $2,000.

Consider a transaction of transferring $150 from ACC2 to ACC1.
``` sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE bankaccounts SET funds = funds - 150 WHERE account_no = 'ACC2';
UPDATE bankaccounts SET funds = funds + 150 WHERE account_no = 'ACC1';
COMMIT;
```
``` sql
SELECT * FROM bankaccounts;
```
Result:
| account_no | funds   |
|------------|---------|
| ACC1       | 1000.00 |
| ACC2       | 1000.00 |

From the above table, it can be observed that the total funds in ACC1 and ACC2 are $2,000. From this, we can conclude that the database is consistent before and after the transaction.

## Isolation
Expanding on this code, we take the following steps:

Step 1: Create a new bank account named ACC3.
``` sql
INSERT INTO bankaccounts VALUES('ACC3', 1000);
```
Step 2: Transaction 1: Crediting $1,000 funds to ACC3.
```sql 
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE bankaccounts SET funds = funds + 1000 WHERE account_no = 'ACC3';
COMMIT;
```
Step 3: Transaction 2: Transferring $100 from ACC2 to ACC1.
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE bankaccounts SET funds = funds - 100 WHERE account_no = 'ACC2';
UPDATE bankaccounts SET funds = funds + 100 WHERE account_no = 'ACC1';
COMMIT;
```
In the above example, transaction 1 and transaction 2 are concurrent, as we are affecting different accounts with each update statement.

## Durability
Now, if we examine our database:

``` sql 
SELECT * FROM bankaccounts;
```
| account_no | funds   |
|------------|---------|
| ACC1       | 1100.00 |
| ACC2       |  900.00 |
| ACC3       | 1000.00 |

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE bankaccounts SET funds = funds + 100 WHERE account_no = 'ACC3';
COMMIT;
```
``` sql 
SELECT * FROM bankaccounts;
```
| account_no | funds   |
|------------|---------|
| ACC1       | 1100.00 |
| ACC2       |  900.00 |
| ACC3       | 1100.00 |

From the above example, it can be observed that the results of the transaction, which involved crediting $100 to ACC3, were successfully updated in the database.

# Summary

- Atomicity combines all statements into a single unit.
  - If a database crashes for some reason, atomicity ensures that the entire transaction is rolled back and partial results are not updated in the database.
- Consistency is important for maintaining data integrity; a database should be consistent before and after a transaction.
  - All inconsistent data is removed, and all transactions that might cause inconsistency are aborted, with an error created or transcribed into an error log.
- Isolation is a property that guarantees the individuality of each transaction and prevents them from being affected by other transactions. 
  - It ensures that transactions are securely and independently processed at the same time without interference, but it does not ensure the order of transactions.
- In a DBMS, durability ensures that the data changes caused by the successful execution of a transaction become permanent in the database. 
  - The durability of the data is so permanent that even if the system fails or crashes, the database still survives and the changes from a transaction are updated in the database.
- The ACID properties of a DBMS play a vital role in maintaining the consistency and availability of data in the database.
