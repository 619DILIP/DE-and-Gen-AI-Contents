## What is data

Data is information with a purpose. In enterprise applications, data provides aggregated state information for the application. Businesses will use this data for various reasons, including marketing, usage statistics, error reporting, and more. Data is specifically designed to provide insights and persistent information for the applications it supports.

## What is a database

A database is a system of software and capabilities that makes validating, storing, searching, filtering, aggregating, grouping, and administering data possible. In enterprise applications, databases fall into two main categories: `SQL` and `NoSQL`.

### SQL databases

SQL databases are a type of RDBMS that use the standard Structured Query Language to administer the data. Data in a SQL database is stored in objects called tables. Tables provide the relational information for the data stored in the database.

### NoSQL databases

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are not necessarily based on the relational model, unlike RDBMS. NoSQL databases typically use some other means or DSL (domain-specific language) for administering data and employ different structures for storing data and relational information.

From the start of the digital revolution, we have witnessed the utmost requirement for storing data effectively and efficiently. Data is the lifeblood of business solutions, and having an accurate database management system is an important tool for handling large volumes of data.

Each database management system offers particular solutions based on business requirements, and decision-makers are often left wondering which system would be appropriate for their use. We will cover various RDBMS vendors in another module to help understand these differences.
