After completing this module, associates should be able to:

- Define DQL clauses
- Understand the purpose of `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY`

</details>
<details><summary>Description</summary>
<br>

- The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the data from the table based on user needs.
- The `GROUP BY` clause is used in MySQL queries to organize records that have the same attribute values.
- The `ORDER BY` clause is used in MySQL queries to return the records in a sorted manner. By default, it returns results in ascending order, which can also be specified as `ASC`. To return results in descending order, we mention `DESC` after the expression along with `ORDER BY`.
- The difference between `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY`

| ORDER BY | GROUP BY |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| It ensures the presentation of columns | It ensures the presentation of rows |
| It is always used after the `GROUP BY` clause in the `SELECT` statement | It is always used before the `ORDER BY` clause in the `SELECT` statement |
| It is not mandatory to use aggregate functions in the `ORDER BY` clause | It is mandatory to use aggregate functions in the `GROUP BY` clause |
| The output is sorted based on the column's attribute values | The grouping of records is done based on the similarity among the row's attribute values |

<br>

Consider a scenario where we want to know the employees' salaries in a particular department and organize the results in descending order based on the department column. In this case, we would need both the `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses to get the desired result.

<details><summary>Implementation</summary> 
<br>

- The syntax to use the `WHERE` clause is:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Example:

```sql
SELECT title
FROM movies
WHERE ticket_price = 200;
```

- The syntax to use the `ORDER BY` clause is:

```sql
SELECT expressions    
FROM tables    
[WHERE conditions]    
ORDER BY expression [ASC | DESC];    
```

Example:

```sql
SELECT marks
FROM STUDENTS
WHERE marks > 60
ORDER BY marks DESC;
```

- The syntax to use the `GROUP BY` clause is:

```sql
SELECT column_name, function(column_name)  
FROM table_name   
WHERE condition   
GROUP BY column_name;  
```

Example 1:

```sql
SELECT Dept, Salary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary > 15000
GROUP BY employee.salary, employee.dept
ORDER BY Dept DESC;
```
Example 2:

```sql
SELECT Dept, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary > 15000
GROUP BY employee.dept
ORDER BY Dept DESC;
```
#### Let's break down the differences:

Column Selection:

- **Example 1:** Selects individual Dept and Salary values.
- **Example 2:** Selects Dept and the average Salary for each department.

`GROUP BY` clause:
        
- **Example 1:** Groups by both salary and department, which doesn't change the result set.
- **Example 2:** Groups only by department, allowing for aggregation of salaries within each department.

Aggregation:

- **Example 1:** No aggregation is performed.
- **Example 2:** Uses `AVG()` to calculate the average salary for each department.

#### When to use each approach:

**Example 1:**

- Use when you want to see individual salary records for each employee in departments where at least one employee earns more than $15,000.
- It's essentially equivalent to removing the `GROUP BY` clause entirely, as it doesn't change the result set.
- This query might be useful for getting a detailed view of high-earning employees across departments.

**Example 2:**

- Use when you want to analyze salary data at the department level.
- It provides a summary view, showing the average salary for each department (considering only salaries above $15,000).
- This is useful for comparing compensation across departments or identifying departments with higher average salaries.

#### The key difference is the level of detail and the type of analysis you're performing:

- The **Example 1** query gives you a granular view of individual salaries.
- The **Example 2** query provides an aggregated view, summarizing salary data by department.

- The `WHERE` clause is not only used in `SELECT` statements; it is also used in `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements.
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result and shows it in ascending or descending order.
- The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group data based on the exact value in a specific field.
