Aggregate functions in MySQL provide output as a single value after performing different operations on a set of values.

The five most commonly used aggregate functions are as follows: 

| Aggregate Function  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| count()  | Returns the number of rows, including rows with NULL values, in a group.  |
| sum()  | Returns the total summed values in a set.  |
| avg()  | Returns the average value of an expression.  |
| min()  | Returns the minimum (lowest) value in a set.  |
| max()  | Returns the maximum (highest) value in a set.  |

### Examples

Counting the number of records in a table:
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMP;    
```

Counting the values of a particular column:
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(EMP_NAME) FROM EMP;   
```

Finding the sum of all values from a specific field:
```SQL
SELECT SUM(duration) AS "Total duration" FROM EMP;
```

Calculating the average of the values from a specified column:
```SQL
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM EMP;
```

Finding the minimum salary:
```SQL
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM EMP;    
```

Finding the maximum salary:
```SQL
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM EMP; 
```
