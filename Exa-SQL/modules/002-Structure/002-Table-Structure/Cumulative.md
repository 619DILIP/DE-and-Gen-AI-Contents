After completing this module, associates should be able to:

- Learn how to `CREATE`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, and `ALTER` a table in a MySQL database.
- Understand the difference between a `TABLE` and a `DATABASE`.
- Learn what a `TUPLE` is.

<br>

- In MySQL, a table stores and organizes data in columns and rows as defined during table creation.
- The `CREATE TABLE` command is used to create a new table in a database.
- The `DROP TABLE` command is used to completely remove the table from the database.
- The `TRUNCATE TABLE` command is used to remove all the data but not the table itself.
- The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to alter the table.

- The major differences between a database and a table are as follows:

    - Tables are a way to represent the division of information in a database, while a database is a collection of tables and records.
    - Tables are used to group the records in relation to each other and create a dataset. This dataset will be used in the database. The data that is stored in the table in any form is a part of the database, but the vice versa is not true.

- `TUPLE` - A tuple refers to an ordered set of values. The number of values, or elements, in a tuple is fixed and is known as the arity of the tuple (arity refers to the number of columns in a table). Each value in the tuple is often called an attribute or a component.

In the context of databases and relational database management systems (RDBMS), a tuple is equivalent to a row in a table. Each tuple represents a single record, and the values in the tuple correspond to the attributes or columns of that record.

For example, consider a simple table representing employees:

Employee Table

| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName | Age | Salary |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----|--------|
| 1          | Susie     | Que      | 30  | 50000  |
| 2          | Billy     | Bob      | 25  | 60000  |
| 3          | Bacon     | Hamburger| 35  | 75000  |

In this table, each row is a tuple. For instance, the first tuple (or row) is (1, "Susie", "Que", 30, 50000), where each value corresponds to a specific attribute such as EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Age, and Salary.

Tuples are used in various areas of computer science, including databases, programming languages, and mathematical modeling, where the concept of an ordered set of values is fundamental.

<details><summary>Real World Application</summary>

<br>

- A table is used in all forms of statistical reports in today's world. 
- It is a sequence of labeled columns of data. 
- It can be used to both store and display data in a structured format.

<details><summary>Implementation</summary> 
<br>

The general syntax for creating a table in MySQL is:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] table_name(  
    column_definition1,  
    column_definition2,  
    ........,  
    table_constraints  
);
```
Example:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE movies(m_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,m_genre VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,m_director VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,m_year INT NOT NULL,PRIMARY KEY(m_name));
```
Add values to the newly created table.

``` sql
INSERT INTO movies VALUES("Mr.Bean", "comedy", "Mr.ABC", 2019);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES("Fox", "horror", "Mr.XYZ", 2020);
```

### DROP vs TRUNCATE

The general syntax for dropping a table in MySQL is:

``` sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

We use the `DROP` command to completely remove the table. Example:

``` sql
DROP TABLE movies;
```

The general syntax for truncating a table in MySQL is:

``` sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```
The `TRUNCATE` command is used to delete the data inside a table, but not the table itself. Example:

``` sql
TRUNCATE TABLE movies;
```

### Modifying structure

To `ADD` a column:

``` sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;
```

We use the `ALTER TABLE` command to modify a table. Example:

``` sql
ALTER TABLE movies
ADD ticket_price INT;
```

To `DROP` a column:

``` sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;
```
Example:

``` sql
ALTER TABLE movies
DROP COLUMN m_genre;
```

To `MODIFY` a column:

``` sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;
```

Example:

``` sql
ALTER TABLE movies
MODIFY COLUMN ticket_price DOUBLE;
```

After reading this module, you will be able to differentiate between a `TABLE` and a `DATABASE`, and describe the following:

- `CREATE` a table.
- `DROP` a table.
- `TRUNCATE` a table.
- `ALTER` a table.
