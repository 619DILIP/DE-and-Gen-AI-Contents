## Data Modeling

Data modeling is a conceptual representation of the data objects, data object relationships, and data object rules. It is used to help save costs, improve documentation, reduce time to market, and establish consistent data.

Data modeling is not strictly limited to relational databases but can include a variety of data models, such as:

    - JSON Data Model
    - Key-Value Data Model
    - Graph Data Model
    - Wide-Column Data Model

These examples of data models are good to know and feel free to research them, but for the purpose of the SQL unit, we focus on the relational data model.

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

An Entity Relationship Diagram is a graphical representation depicting the relationships among data objects within a database. These entities, such as people, objects, or concepts, relate to one another within the database. Also known as ER Models, these define a set of symbols such as rectangles, diamonds, and connecting lines to depict the entities’ relationships and their attributes. Seen in the example below:

![](../../resources/schema_example.png)

Each table is titled with a name representing the entity. At the top of each table, there is a key symbol depicting our primary key, red diamonds for foreign keys, and all others denoting the remaining entity attributes.

## Data Modeling

Data modeling is used in practice for evaluating the data objects and their relationships to other entities used to investigate the business's data requirements for processes.

For example, let's think about a driver's license. We can use data modeling to determine if we have enough available combinations for our unique identifiers. When generating ID identifiers, we need to make sure the data type and constraints we've established are sufficient to handle our needs, accounting for the growth of the population. Prior to implementation, we can establish the rules for our data, saving us time, money, and headaches in the future.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

Entity Relationship Diagrams allow us to visualize the entities, their attributes, and relationships to one another. This can be done via third-party software such as Microsoft Visio or LucidChart, but inside most database IDEs, there is some form of basic ERD generation tool. As you have seen previously, the image below is an example of an ERD generated through an IDE (DBeaver):

![](../../resources/schema_example.png)

We can see symbols at the end of relationship lines that link the entities. These symbols indicate how many instances of one entity are related to how many instances of another entity. In Crow's Foot notation, there are usually two symbols beside one another. For the first symbol, it can be a crow's foot, which indicates many instances, or it can be a single line, which represents a single instance. For the second symbol, it can be either a single line to indicate it is mandatory or a circle, which represents that it is optional (there can be zero instances). Note that other notations use different symbols.

Using the above ERD for a commerce database, you can see how stores, customers, departments, and sales information are all intertwined.

Data Modeling and ERDs can be generated through third-party software such as Microsoft Visio, LucidChart, and a variety of other web-based diagram tools. For our purpose, we can simply make ERDs with our database IDE (DBeaver). While in DBeaver, to generate an ERD of your database, simply follow these steps:

1. Select your database and expand it in the Database Navigator Menu on the left-hand side.
2. Expand your Databases inside your database.
3. Expand the name of your database.
4. Expand the Schemas directory.
5. Right-click on the schema for which you wish to generate an ERD, and select View Diagram.
6. DBeaver will open a new tab in the editor with an extremely basic version of an ERD for your tables. See below:

Data modeling is a process for developing the data model for storing information within a database, used in practice for evaluating the data objects and their relationships to other entities used to investigate the business's data requirements for processes.
- The Relational Data Model is only one of a few different types, but the one we focus on for SQL.

An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a graphical representation depicting the relationships among data objects within a database for entities with relationships such as people, objects, or concepts.
- ERDs can be generated with third-party applications.
- Simple ERDs can be generated through your database IDE.
